# GDNative driver for OpenXR

## Versions

Requires Godot 3.2.

If not yet merged you must use a custom compile with the follow PR included:
https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42531

Note: The godot engine (the full engine, not this plugin) must be compiled in release_debug mode, i.e. with

    scons platform=x11 target=release_debug

If godot engine is compiled with `target=debug` instead, you might get a (bogus) error from monado

    client_gl_compositor_init - Needed extension GL_EXT_memory_object_fd not supported

On the other hand the godot_openxr plugin can be compiled in debug mode without issues.

## Status

* This plugin only supports Linux/X11. Windows support is in early WIP.
* VR is tested with SteamVR and Monado
* Explicit support for controller input with interaction profile:
  * Valve Index Controller
  * Monado Playstation Move Controller
* Limited support for other controllers via Khronos Simple interaction profile.

## Building this module
In order to compile this module you will have to clone the source code to disk. You will need a C/C++ compiler, python and scons installed. This is the same toolchain you will need in order to compile Godot from master. The documentation on Godot is a very good place to read up on this. It is too much information to duplicate here.
You will also need cmake if you're compiling the OpenXR SDK loader

### Godot headers
Currently this project includes the godot_headers repository as a submodule.
This requires no further compilation steps but if the `godot_headers` folder is missing or empty execute:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### OpenXR SDK loader
OpenXR on desktop PCs usually requires using a loader provided by Khronos, you can find the source here: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK

On Linux the loader and include files should be installed system wide via package manager (or manually) within the `/usr` folder structure and they should be picked up automatically.

On Windows a precompiled version of the loaded can be found in `openxr_loader_windows`, currently only the x86 version is used.

### Compiling the plugin
If everything is in place compiling should be pretty straight forward

For Windows: ```scons platform=windows```
For Linux: ```scons platform=linux```

On older linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04) the plugin may not build with gcc.
In this case install clang and compile the plugin with ```scons use_llvm=yes platform=linux```

Currently there is no proper OpenXR support on OSX.

The compiled plugin and related files will be placed in `demo/addons/`.
When using godot_openxr in another project, copy this directory.

If you compile with gcc and encounter the error message
```
sorry, unimplemented: non-trivial designated initializers not supported
```
it probably means your gcc is too old (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04).
The easiest way around this is to compile the plugin with clang instead.
```
apt install clang
scons platform=linux use_llvm=yes
```

Testing
-------
After compiling the plugin, start Godot, open the godot_openxr/demo project and click play.

Demo
----
There is a demo project contained within this repository as well that shows how to set things up.

Using this module in your own project
-------------------------------------

Example: Converting a godot-openvr project

1. Remove the `addons/godot-openvr` directory from the project.
2. Copy the `godot-openxr/demo/addons/godot-openxr` directory to `your_project/addons/`.
3. If your project was already set up to use OpenVR, find `ARVRServer.find_interface("OpenVR")` and replace `"OpenVR"` with `"OpenXR"`.

Since the module is laid out like godot-openvr, the basic documentation for integrating OpenVR into a project also applies to OpenXR.

The only differences should be: Since there is no OpenXR asset on the store, the godot-openxr directory has to be manually put into the project's addon/ directory and in the project's gdscript the `OpenXR` string has to be used in the `find_interface()` call.
