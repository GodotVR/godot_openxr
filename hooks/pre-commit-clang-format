# git pre-commit hook that runs a clang-format stylecheck.
# Features:
#  - abort commit when commit does not comply with the style guidelines
#  - create a patch of the proposed style changes
# Modifications for clang-format by rene.milk@wwu.de

# This file is part of a set of unofficial pre-commit hooks available
