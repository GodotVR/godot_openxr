# Updating

### How to update

1. Check out the source repo from the URL above
2. Make sure you have your local ANDROID_NDK path setup.
3. Your local machine needs to have Cmake, Ninja, and clang. (If you do not have Ninja or it does not work, you can remove this from the following build script)
4. Run ci_tools/build_android.sh - You may need to modify this script to manually input your ANDROID_NDK path
5. Move the newly built libktx.so, libktx_read.so, and libobjUtil.a files into lib/android/arm64-v8a
6. Replace include/ktx.h with the latest from github (if necessary)
